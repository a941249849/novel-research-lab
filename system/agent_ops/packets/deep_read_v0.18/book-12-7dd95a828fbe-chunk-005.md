# NRL Antigravity Deep-Read Chunk v0.18

Read the exact byte range below from the shared local source file. Analyze the
range itself; do not rely on existing summaries. Do not quote source prose.

- chunk_id: `book-12-7dd95a828fbe-chunk-005`
- source_file: `novel_training_set/《永生》（校对版全本）作者：梦入神机.txt`
- source_file_sha256: `7dd95a828fbe1e4b3c91e761bd3ca59eeef5230a893aa7e1358d316b247b545a`
- start_byte: 6000468
- end_byte: 7500469
- chunk_sha256: `54ec3983aaf56c125617ca1c525a9ae2853eec259acbb1db161a3d0385895ac4`
- bounded_chunk_file: `.nrl-work/deep_read_v0.18/chunks/book-12-7dd95a828fbe-chunk-005.txt`

The bounded chunk file contains exactly the bytes identified above. Read that
entire bounded file before responding. Do not inspect or summarize a different
range and do not use pre-existing book reports as a substitute.

Return one JSON object only with these binding fields and an `analysis` object.
The analysis must contain non-empty arrays named `major_events`,
`character_state_transitions`, `long_form_mechanisms`,
`continuity_observations`, `style_observations`, and `originality_risks`;
`chapter_span` as an array; and `creation_family_evidence` as a non-empty object.
Use chapter titles or abstract event labels as evidence anchors, never raw prose.
The job_id is `job-v018-verifiable-deep-reading` and contract_version is `0.18`. Copy every
binding field exactly from this template and replace only the analysis values:
