# NRL Antigravity Deep-Read Chunk v0.18

Read the exact byte range below from the shared local source file. Analyze the
range itself; do not rely on existing summaries. Do not quote source prose.

- chunk_id: `book-17-3089d9aab05c-chunk-003`
- source_file: `novel_training_set/《雪中悍刀行》（校对版全本）作者：烽火戏诸侯.txt`

- start_byte: 3000736
- end_byte: 4500743
- chunk_sha256: `75e95fdb582df27c0eba18806bfe1b25bf78d6ec1bec5a7eea65ad22002d46cf`

- bounded_chunk_utf8_sha256: `c6c1cb404cb3e12f3251f8c7d02ad0c1eb50f92da6ca349d8d145989f6e58e03`

The bounded chunk file contains exactly the bytes identified above. Read that
entire bounded file before responding. Do not inspect or summarize a different
range and do not use pre-existing book reports as a substitute.

Return one JSON object only with these binding fields and an `analysis` object.
The analysis must contain non-empty arrays named `major_events`,
`character_state_transitions`, `long_form_mechanisms`,
`continuity_observations`, `style_observations`, and `originality_risks`;
`chapter_span` as an array; and `creation_family_evidence` as a non-empty object.
Use chapter titles or abstract event labels as evidence anchors, never raw prose.
For million-byte chunks, provide at least 16 major events, 10 character-state
transitions, 8 long-form mechanisms, 8 continuity observations, 6 style
observations, and 4 originality risks. Cite at least 8 exact chapter headings
from the bounded UTF-8 file when that many headings exist.
The job_id is `job-v018-verifiable-deep-reading` and contract_version is `0.18`. Copy every
binding field exactly from this template and replace only the analysis values:
