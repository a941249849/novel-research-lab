# NRL Antigravity Deep-Read Chunk v0.18

Read the exact byte range below from the shared local source file. Analyze the
range itself; do not rely on existing summaries. Do not quote source prose.

- chunk_id: `book-18-d53c5cc79ddd-chunk-014`
- source_file: `novel_training_set/蛊真人.txt`
- source_file_sha256: `d53c5cc79ddd02c45ad8e6ad334a3f8feac558c67726486d9f41417cfd718d88`
- start_byte: 19500993
- end_byte: 19898596
- chunk_sha256: `2a85acdb4b842a8030086dabd48a1e162b86bd21f7302cff2f438177cf8faf33`
- bounded_chunk_file: `.nrl-work/deep_read_v0.18/chunks/book-18-d53c5cc79ddd-chunk-014.txt`

The bounded chunk file contains exactly the bytes identified above. Read that
entire bounded file before responding. Do not inspect or summarize a different
range and do not use pre-existing book reports as a substitute.

Return one JSON object only with these binding fields and an `analysis` object.
The analysis must contain non-empty arrays named `major_events`,
`character_state_transitions`, `long_form_mechanisms`,
`continuity_observations`, `style_observations`, and `originality_risks`;
`chapter_span` as an array; and `creation_family_evidence` as a non-empty object.
Use chapter titles or abstract event labels as evidence anchors, never raw prose.
The job_id is `job-v018-verifiable-deep-reading` and contract_version is `0.18`. Copy every
binding field exactly from this template and replace only the analysis values:
