# NRL Antigravity Deep-Read Chunk v0.18

Read the exact byte range below from the shared local source file. Analyze the
range itself; do not rely on existing summaries. Do not quote source prose.

- chunk_id: `book-01-45bcee82acba-chunk-003`
- source_file: `novel_training_set/《一念永恒》（校对版全本）作者：耳根.txt`
- source_file_sha256: `45bcee82acba82c9429c597a2b7d8689a0ce1c90dd78238ab0e6e8b8d02b30c3`
- start_byte: 3000096
- end_byte: 4500246
- chunk_sha256: `4cf484406f34a9a9ba0ffac3e2f3ceed040afd43af882d7c095b6b23e0b9e6e2`
- bounded_chunk_file: `.nrl-work/deep_read_v0.18/chunks/book-01-45bcee82acba-chunk-003.txt`

The bounded chunk file contains exactly the bytes identified above. Read that
entire bounded file before responding. Do not inspect or summarize a different
range and do not use pre-existing book reports as a substitute.

Return one JSON object only with these binding fields and an `analysis` object.
The analysis must contain non-empty arrays named `major_events`,
`character_state_transitions`, `long_form_mechanisms`,
`continuity_observations`, `style_observations`, and `originality_risks`;
`chapter_span` as an array; and `creation_family_evidence` as a non-empty object.
Use chapter titles or abstract event labels as evidence anchors, never raw prose.
The job_id is `job-v018-verifiable-deep-reading` and contract_version is `0.18`. Copy every
binding field exactly from this template and replace only the analysis values:
